## Thanks for checking out DangerQuest!

DangerQuest is a text based Ruby game I made on 3/22/14 for Launch Academy's one day Ship it Saturday hackathon. It was after the fifth week of Launch Academy.

The game must be played in the console by running the `dangerquest.rb` file. This was a personal side project, and is super ridiculous! If you're looking more for TDD and Rails and less for ridiculous text game adventures check out https://github.com/michaelboerger/car_dealership.

I'm happy with how the game came out for a one day project and really enjoyed making it. The `template.rb` file explains how the game works and allows people to make their own rooms; it is also ridiculous.
